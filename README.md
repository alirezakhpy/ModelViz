# ModelViz
ModelViz is a prototype tool that automates the generation of visual analytics dashboard code for supply chain management applications. ModelViz consists of three parts:
1. A Metamodel created using Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).
2. An Eclipse Sirius graphical workbench for creating models that facilitates the interaction with the metamodel.
3. An Eclipse Acceleo Model-To-Text transformer that is a code template and creates dashboard codes from the model.

The ModelViz prototype is created as part of the DigiMat project at Ã˜stfold Univeristy College, Norway.
